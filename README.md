## Overview 

For voracious readers, the internet can be a blessing and a curse. There are so many sites out there, with so much great content, so many links to click, so many recommendations to follow. It's easy to end up with a seemingly endless collection of open browser tabs, and no time to sit at your computer to read them all. 

Enter ReadMe: an offline-first mobile app that—together with its [companion browser extension](https://github.com/Project-Readme/ReadMe-browser-extension "extension repository")—allows a reader to save articles, blog posts, and other text from their desktops and retrieve that content later for reading on their mobile device. If a user does run out of things to read our app has recommendations for them on the home screen. 

TheReadMe App was built by [Simon](https://github.com/SimonGutierrez), [Daniel](https://github.com/dan2298), [Sarah](https://github.com/sarahtrefethen) and [Bryce](https://github.com/theNdroid) using React Native, Redux, and Cloud Firestore.   

## Getting Started

This app is available on the [Expo](https://expo.io/ "Expo homepage") platform. After you have installed Expo onto your device you can run the app via this [link](https://expo.io/@tresarah/ReadMe-RN) (the easier option) or by building your own copy.  

To build you own copy, clone this repository to your local machine and install it with the [npm cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm "npm cli documentation") by running `npm install`. 

With Expo installed, you can then run `npm start` to launch the app. 

To log in to our app you can create an account, or use the following credentials:
> username: guest<br />
> password: password
